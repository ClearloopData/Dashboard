# Watttime API Connection

## Code by Daniel Henricks for Clearloop.

### What's in this repo:

- Some pre-existing code that was used to connect to the current Firebase database
- Components that display current and historical power emissions
- Prototypes for displaying this data

### To-do:

1. Convert previous Svelte dashboard into existing tech stack (React, Firebase)
2. Create engaging and real-time graphics to display Vandy carbon footprint data
3. Style the existing components more consistently.
